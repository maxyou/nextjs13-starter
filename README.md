A Next.js-13 starter with the new app router. I'm trying to add features to make it a complete starter for future projects.

## Done

- Yoga as graphQL server
- URQL as graphQL client
- Prisma to access PostgreSQL
- todo list

## ToDo

- some kind of authentication system
- tailwind-elements or daisyUI?
